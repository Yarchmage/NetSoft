The 9th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization (IEEE NetSoft 2023) will be held in Madrid, Spain from June 19 to June 23, 2023. We are pleased to welcome you to Madrid, the capital of Spain and one of the most friendly and multi-cultural cities of Europe! The conference will be hosted by University Carlos III of Madrid, one of the best Spanish universities in many technical areas, in its downtown campus in Madrid. 
 
IEEE NetSoft 2023 will feature an intense five-day conference program. The core of the conference will run from June 20 to June 22 and will feature inspiring Keynote Talks delivered by world-class researchers and industry representatives. It also includes a Distinguished Expert Panel, Technical Sessions, as well as Demos showcasing prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations of ongoing research ideas. On June 19 and June 23, the program includes workshops and tutorials that will provide the opportunity to deep dive into the focused topics on network softwarization. In addition, in this edition for the first time a PhD symposium will take place to engage PhD students in the vibrant NetSoft community and give them the opportunity to exchange ideas and receive valuable and constructive feedback for PhD work.
